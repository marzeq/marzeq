# These are all the dotfiles I use on a frequent basis.

You can install them alongside some programs I frequently use using the `install.sh` script. Disclaimer: the script only supports Arch and Debian/Ubuntu based distros. On distros like Fedora, some packages are supported, while others will prompt you to install the packages manually. You can also skip installing the programs alltogether and install just the dotfiles.
